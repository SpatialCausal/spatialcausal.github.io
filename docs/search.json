    "text": "Call for Participation\n\nScope\nCausal analysis, including causal discovery, causal inference and causal representation learning, is fundamental to understanding the behaviors of a natural and societal system, and for our ability to design and target interventions on such systems. The majority of spatial sciences and spatial statistical research has focused on descriptive or predictive (forecasting) objectives, shielding away from making causal claims, and therefore also from methodological efforts that are required by explicit causal interpretation of results. Furthermore, classical causal approaches make strong assumptions about the I.I.D nature of the data, the consistency of exposures, or the exchangeability of observations – all of which may very likely be violated in spatial contexts.\nWe invite researchers interested in the ability to make causal claims based on analyses in spatial disciplines incl. Earth science, epidemiology, transportation, urban planning, and economics, interested in forming a shared conceptual, terminological, and methodological understanding of spatial causal analysis and methods to communicate outcomes of causal analysis to the public to a seminar at GIScience 2025.\nThis workshop is a part of a concerted effort triggered by a Dagstuhl Seminar on Causal Inference for Spatial Data Analytics in 2024 to build a community around spatial causal analysis. Our objective is to convene a diverse group of researchers and practitioners that contribute to spatial causal research, a field that has only started to emerge of its own.\n\n\nPosition Statements\nWe are seeking short position statements (max two page, GIScience/LIPICS formatting) position statements to address the above topics in spatial causal analysis, as a starting point to a discussion that will result in an effort to synthesize, and articulate a joint position/vision paper.\nPosition statements will be assessed for topical fit by the Programme Committee, and circulated amongst workshop participants prior to the event and posted on the workshop website. During the workshop, participants will present their position statements during a lightning talk session where each participant is given 3-5 minutes to present their topic of interest or relevant work.\nWe particularly want to attract participants from GIScience adjacent fields ( spatial epidemiology, transport, spatial economics and housing research, spatial data visualisation), and from industry where causal inference is applied and its geographical components are likely to be of interest (e.g., real estate, rentals, ride sharing and on-demand mobility) to participate.\nTopics:\n\nConceptual foundations of spatial causal inference\nStatistical approaches to spatial inference\nSpatial causal discovery\nShared datasets and case-studies for causal discovery\nSynthetic datasets for testing spatial methods\nCounterfactual claims in spatial systems\nFrom descriptions of spatial processes to causal interventions\nImpact of sampling, measurement sensitivity and data uncertainty,\ngeneralizability of spatial causal claims\nVisualisation and communication about statistical causal claims, treatment effects, and confounders\nSpatial causal toolbox\nApplications of spatial casual inference, incl in industry\nSpatial causal community\n\n\n\nHighlights\nThe workshop will convene a panel to discuss the challenges of identifying and measuring spatio-temporal effects in causal analysis. While many typical questions refer more directly to the estimation of such effects, the issues that pertain to the discovery of causal relations should be considered as well."

    "text": "This community has emerged from the initial [Dagstuhl seminar] (https://www.dagstuhl.de/24202) on Causal Inference for Spatial Data Analytics in 2024. It serves researchers and industry practitioners who share interest in causal inference and discovery (aka analysis) and are interested to explore how space (or geography) challenges assumptions and methodological approaches in causal analysis. We are interested in spatial confounding, the role of spatial autocorrelation between units (on treatments, effects, and covariates), and in practical aspects how to undertake spatial casual analysis.\nTo support systematic causal consideration in the diverse disciplines that deal with spatial concepts, incl. Earth science, epidemiology, transportation, urban planning, and economics, and statistics, by establishing a common conceptual, terminological, and methodological foundation that will bring these communities together in the first place by centering the spatial nature of data, and the understanding of their generation through geographical processes.\nThe terminology and methods that have emerged in causal inference is currently always, to an extent, alien to at least part of the community. We have the ambition to serve as a bridge between these disciplines, provide a platform for discussions, and share resources, tools and tutorials."

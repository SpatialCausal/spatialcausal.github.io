    "text": "This community has emerged from the initial [Dagstuhl seminar] (https://www.dagstuhl.de/24202) on Causal Inference for Spatial Data Analytics in 2024. It serves researchers and industry practitioners who share interest in causal inference and discovery (aka analysis) and are interested to explore how space (or geography) challenges assumptions and methodological approaches in causal analysis. We are interested in spatial confounding, the role of spatial autocorrelation between units (on treatments, effects, and covariates), and in practical aspects how to undertake spatial casual analysis.\nThe terminology that emerged in causal inference is, to a large extent, alien to much of the GIScience community, for instance, and is also disparate between researchers comming from (spatial) epidemiology vs those arriving from, (spatial) economics. Other domains considering spatial causal analysis may include geoscientists and Earth scientists, meteorologists, transportantion engineers, demographers. We have the ambition to serve as a bridge between these communities, provide a platform for discussions, and share resources, tools and tutorials."

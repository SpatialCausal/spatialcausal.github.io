## Welcome to the Spatial-Causal.org community

This website serves as the crossroad for the spatial-causal.org community, an open, welcoming community of researchers and practitioners interested in Spatial Causal Analysis ( from inferenece to discovery, and their applications).  

This website will serve pointers to community [events](events.qmd) (seminars, workshops, conferences - please, let us know about anything happening!), it will gather resources and papers - once they emerge, and will list members of the community that may want to be listed (possibly as a resource for interested students seeking PhD supervision).

We hope that the community will, in time, be bale to gather multiple times a year at conferences covering both GIScience/geographical analysis (GIScience, ACM SIGSPATIAL)
